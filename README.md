# CENTRALIZED-MOVIE-SYSTEM

This project aims to revolutionize the movie-going experience by creating a Centralized Movie System powered by SQL for efficient ticketing and theater management. Designed to cater to both major cinema chains and independent theaters, this system provides users with a unified platform to browse movies, view showtimes, and purchase tickets online. Key features include a centralized website for movie discovery, location-based theater recommendations, detailed movie descriptions, customizable seat assignments, and secure transactions. For theater administrators, the system offers tools for ticket inventory management, attendance tracking, and data-driven decision-making. By bridging the gap between theaters and audiences, the system ensures an accessible, user-friendly, and streamlined movie ticketing experience for everyone.
